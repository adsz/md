# üöÄ DevOps Concepts Glossary - Interview Reference

## üß† DevOps Philosophy & Culture

### üí° The DevOps Mindset
**Core Principle**: Breaking down silos between Development and Operations teams.
**Goal**: Faster, more reliable software delivery through collaboration, automation, and shared responsibility.
**Interview tip**: Emphasize culture change over just tools - "DevOps is not a job title, it's a methodology."

### üîÑ Three Ways of DevOps (Gene Kim)
1. **Flow**: Optimize work flowing from Dev ‚Üí Ops ‚Üí Customer
2. **Feedback**: Create fast feedback loops from right to left
3. **Continuous Learning**: Culture of experimentation and learning from failures

**Interview example**: "We implemented fast feedback by adding automated testing at every stage, reducing our mean time to detection from hours to minutes."

### üéØ CALMS Framework
- **Culture**: Collaboration, shared responsibility, blameless post-mortems
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks, reduce human error
- **Lean**: Eliminate waste, optimize flow, small batch sizes
- **Measurement**: Data-driven decisions, monitor everything
- **Sharing**: Knowledge sharing, documentation, cross-training

### üìà DevOps Transformation Stages
1. **Chaotic**: Manual processes, blame culture, long release cycles
2. **Reactive**: Some automation, basic monitoring, still siloed
3. **Proactive**: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, collaboration
4. **Managed**: Comprehensive monitoring, self-healing systems
5. **Optimized**: Full automation, predictive analytics, innovation culture

**Interview tip**: Position yourself at stage 3-4 and show examples of moving teams forward.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core DevOps & Cloud Concepts

### üîê RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
**What**: Security model that restricts system access based on user roles rather than individual permissions.
**Example**: Developer role can deploy to dev/staging but not prod. SRE role can access all environments.
**Interview tip**: Mention least privilege principle and separation of duties.

### üèóÔ∏è IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
**What**: Managing infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.
**Tools**: Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, CDK
**Benefits**: Version control, repeatability, automation, drift detection
**Interview tip**: Emphasize idempotency and declarative vs imperative approaches.

### üîÑ GitOps
**What**: Operational framework using Git as single source of truth for infrastructure and applications.
**How**: Git commits trigger automated deployments. Rollback = git revert.
**Tools**: ArgoCD, Flux, Jenkins X
**Interview tip**: Mention pull vs push models and reconciliation loops.

### üí• Blast Radius
**What**: Maximum impact scope when something fails in your infrastructure.
**Mitigation**: Small, isolated components; separate state files; multiple AWS accounts
**Example**: VPC failure in dev doesn't affect prod when properly isolated.

### üîÅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
**What**: Software principle to reduce code duplication.
**In Terraform**: Use modules, Terragrunt, variables, and locals.
**Benefits**: Easier maintenance, consistency, fewer bugs.

### üíæ Terraform State Management - COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE

#### What is Terraform State?
**Definition**: JSON file that maps Terraform configuration to real-world resources. It's Terraform's "source of truth" about your infrastructure.

**Why State Exists**:
1. **Resource Mapping**: Links resources in config to actual cloud resources
2. **Metadata Storage**: Tracks resource dependencies and properties
3. **Performance**: Caches attribute values to reduce API calls
4. **Collaboration**: Enables team coordination via shared state

#### State File Structure
```json
{
  "version": 4,
  "terraform_version": "1.5.0",
  "serial": 42,  // Increments with each state change
  "lineage": "uuid",  // Tracks state file history
  "outputs": {},
  "resources": [
    {
      "mode": "managed",  // or "data" for data sources
      "type": "aws_instance",
      "name": "web",
      "provider": "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws\"]",
      "instances": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Critical State Management Concepts

**1. Remote State Backend**
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "env/prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-west-1"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "arn:aws:kms:..."
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
```

**Benefits of Remote State**:
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared access to state
- **State Locking**: Prevents concurrent modifications
- **Encryption**: Protects sensitive data
- **Versioning**: State history and recovery
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth

**2. State Locking**
**Purpose**: Prevents concurrent state modifications that could corrupt state.

**How it Works**:
1. Before any operation, Terraform acquires lock
2. Lock contains info: Who, When, Operation ID
3. Lock released after operation completes
4. If process crashes, lock must be manually released

**DynamoDB for Locking**:
```
Table: terraform-state-lock
Primary Key: LockID (String)
Attributes: Info, Created, TTL
```

**Force Unlock** (Emergency only):
```bash
terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
```

**3. State File Security**

**Sensitive Data in State**:
- Passwords, API keys, certificates
- Private IP addresses
- Database connection strings
- Any resource attributes

**Security Best Practices**:
1. **Never commit to Git**: Use .gitignore
2. **Enable encryption**: At-rest (S3-SSE, KMS) and in-transit (TLS)
3. **Restrict access**: IAM policies, bucket policies
4. **Enable versioning**: S3 versioning for recovery
5. **Audit access**: CloudTrail for state bucket
6. **Separate states**: Per environment, per component

**4. State File Operations**

**Common Commands**:
```bash
# List resources in state
terraform state list

# Show specific resource
terraform state show aws_instance.web

# Move resource within state
terraform state mv aws_instance.old aws_instance.new

# Remove from state (not from cloud!)
terraform state rm aws_instance.web

# Pull current state
terraform state pull > current.tfstate

# Push modified state (DANGEROUS!)
terraform state push modified.tfstate

# Replace provider
terraform state replace-provider hashicorp/aws registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws
```

**5. State Import**
Import existing resources into Terraform management:
```bash
# Import EC2 instance
terraform import aws_instance.web i-1234567890abcdef0

# Import with for_each
terraform import 'aws_instance.web["prod"]' i-1234567890abcdef0
```

**Import Workflow**:
1. Write resource configuration
2. Run import command
3. Run `terraform plan` to verify
4. Adjust configuration to match reality
5. Achieve clean plan

**6. Workspace Management**
**Purpose**: Multiple states from same configuration (dev, staging, prod).

```bash
# Create and switch workspace
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace select prod
terraform workspace list

# Reference in configuration
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  instance_type = terraform.workspace == "prod" ? "t3.large" : "t3.micro"
}
```

**Workspace State Storage**:
- Local: `terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace>/`
- S3: `env:/<workspace>/terraform.tfstate`

**7. State Splitting & Combining**

**Why Split State**:
- **Reduce blast radius**: Isolated failure domains
- **Improve performance**: Smaller state files
- **Team ownership**: Different teams manage different components
- **Security**: Separate sensitive resources

**Splitting Strategy**:
```
/infrastructure
  /networking (VPC, Subnets, IGW)
  /compute (EC2, ASG, ALB)
  /data (RDS, ElastiCache, S3)
  /security (IAM, KMS, Secrets)
```

**Using Remote State Data**:
```hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "network" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "terraform-state"
    key    = "network/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-1"
  }
}

# Use outputs from network state
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  subnet_id = data.terraform_remote_state.network.outputs.private_subnet_ids[0]
}
```

**8. State Disaster Recovery**

**Backup Strategies**:
1. **S3 Versioning**: Enable on state bucket
2. **Cross-region replication**: Replicate to another region
3. **External backups**: Periodic copies to different account
4. **State snapshots**: Before major changes

**Recovery Procedures**:
```bash
# Recover from S3 version
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket terraform-state
aws s3api get-object --bucket terraform-state --key terraform.tfstate --version-id <VERSION_ID> recovered.tfstate

# Restore state
terraform state push recovered.tfstate
```

**9. Common State Issues & Solutions**

**Issue: State Lock Stuck**
```bash
# Check who has lock
aws dynamodb get-item --table-name terraform-locks --key '{"LockID":{"S":"bucket/key"}}'

# Force unlock if needed
terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
```

**Issue: State Drift**
```bash
# Detect drift
terraform plan -refresh-only

# Update state from reality
terraform apply -refresh-only
```

**Issue: Corrupted State**
1. Restore from S3 version
2. Or rebuild from terraform import
3. Or use terraform state pull/push with manual fixes

**10. Interview Questions & Answers**

**Q: "Why does Terraform need state?"**
A: "State maps configuration to real resources, stores metadata like dependencies, caches attributes for performance, and enables team collaboration through shared state."

**Q: "How do you handle state in a team environment?"**
A: "We use S3 remote backend with DynamoDB locking to prevent concurrent modifications. State is encrypted with KMS, versioned for recovery, and we use separate state files per environment with strict IAM policies."

**Q: "What happens if state file is lost?"**
A: "First, check S3 versioning for recovery. If truly lost, you can recreate by using terraform import for each resource, though this is time-consuming. Best practice is prevention through backups and versioning."

**Q: "How do you manage state file security?"**
A: "Never commit to Git, enable encryption at-rest and in-transit, use IAM to restrict access, enable CloudTrail auditing, store in private S3 bucket with versioning, and regularly rotate KMS keys."

**Q: "Explain state locking"**
A: "State locking prevents race conditions when multiple users run Terraform simultaneously. We use DynamoDB for distributed locking. Each operation acquires a lock with metadata about who's running what, preventing corruption."

**Q: "How do you organize state for large infrastructure?"**
A: "Split state by component (network, compute, data) and environment. This reduces blast radius, improves performance, and allows team ownership. Components communicate via remote state data sources or parameter store."

**Q: "What's the difference between terraform refresh and plan?"**
A: "Refresh updates state file with real infrastructure status. Plan shows differences between desired configuration and current state. Plan includes an implicit refresh unless disabled with -refresh=false."

#### Best Practices Summary
1. **Always use remote state** for production
2. **Enable state locking** to prevent corruption
3. **Encrypt state files** (contain secrets)
4. **Version state files** for disaster recovery
5. **Split state files** to reduce blast radius
6. **Never manual edit** state unless emergency
7. **Regular backups** before major changes
8. **Monitor state operations** via CloudTrail
9. **Document state structure** for team
10. **Test disaster recovery** procedures

### üé≠ Assume Role Pattern
**What**: AWS security pattern where users assume temporary roles instead of having permanent credentials.
**Benefits**: Enhanced security, audit trail, credential rotation, cross-account access
**Implementation**: User ‚Üí AssumeRole ‚Üí Temporary credentials (STS) ‚Üí Access resources

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS-Specific Concepts

### üåê VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
**What**: Isolated network within AWS cloud.
**Components**: Subnets, route tables, IGW, NAT Gateway, NACLs, Security Groups
**Interview tip**: Explain difference between public/private/database subnets.

### üë§ IAM (Identity and Access Management)

**Data Sources**: Read existing infrastructure (data.aws_ami, data.aws_caller_identity)
**Use Case**: Reference existing resources not managed by current Terraform code.

## üöÄ CI/CD Concepts & Deployment Strategies

### üîµüü¢ Blue-Green Deployment - DETAILED
**What**: Two identical production environments (Blue=current, Green=new), switch traffic between them.

**How it works**:
1. Blue environment serves all production traffic
2. Deploy new version to Green environment
3. Run tests and validations on Green
4. Switch router/load balancer to Green
5. Keep Blue as instant rollback option
6. After validation period, Blue becomes next staging target

**Benefits**:
- **Zero downtime**: Traffic switch is instantaneous
- **Instant rollback**: Just switch back to Blue
- **Full testing**: Test in production-like environment before switch
- **Clean cutover**: No mixed versions

**Challenges**:
- **Cost**: Double infrastructure during deployment
- **Database migrations**: Need backward-compatible changes
- **Stateful services**: Session/cache management during switch
- **Long-running transactions**: May be interrupted

**AWS Implementation**:
```
Route53 (weighted routing) ‚Üí ALB ‚Üí Target Groups (Blue/Green)
CodeDeploy with Blue/Green deployments
ECS/EKS with multiple services
Elastic Beanstalk environment swap
```

**Interview Example Answer**:
"We implemented blue-green using Route53 weighted routing policies. During deployment, we'd shift 100% traffic from blue to green after validation. Database migrations were handled separately with backward compatibility for at least one version. This reduced our deployment risk and enabled rollback in under 30 seconds."

### üê¶ Canary Deployment - DETAILED
**What**: Gradually roll out changes to small subset of users/servers before full deployment.

**Canary Patterns**:
1. **Linear**: 10% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% over time
2. **Exponential**: 1% ‚Üí 2% ‚Üí 4% ‚Üí 8% ‚Üí 16% ‚Üí 32% ‚Üí 64% ‚Üí 100%
3. **Custom**: Based on business rules (e.g., internal users first)

**Benefits**:
- **Risk mitigation**: Issues affect small percentage
- **Real user testing**: Actual production traffic
- **Gradual rollout**: Time to monitor metrics
- **A/B testing capability**: Compare versions

**Monitoring During Canary**:
- Error rates (4xx, 5xx)
- Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Business metrics (conversion, user actions)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory)
- Custom application metrics

**Rollback Triggers**:
- Error rate > threshold (e.g., 1% increase)
- Latency degradation > 10%
- Business metric drop > defined percentage
- Manual intervention

**Tools & Implementation**:
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Native canary support
- **Kubernetes**: Flagger, Argo Rollouts
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, AWS App Mesh
- **Feature Flags**: LaunchDarkly, AWS AppConfig

**Interview Example Answer**:
"We used canary deployments with Flagger in Kubernetes, starting with 5% traffic. We monitored error rates, p99 latency, and business KPIs. If any metric exceeded thresholds, automatic rollback triggered. This caught a memory leak that only appeared under production load, preventing a major incident."

### üåä Rolling Deployment - DETAILED
**What**: Gradually replace instances with new version one at a time or in batches.

**Strategy Options**:
- **One at a time**: Minimize capacity reduction
- **Half at a time**: Faster but requires overcapacity
- **Custom batch size**: Based on fleet size and risk tolerance

**Process**:
1. Take instance out of service (drain connections)
2. Deploy new version
3. Health checks
4. Return to service
5. Repeat for next instance/batch

**Benefits**:
- **No extra infrastructure**: Cost-effective
- **Configurable pace**: Control rollout speed
- **Gradual validation**: Issues appear gradually

**Challenges**:
- **Mixed versions**: Compatibility required
- **Slow rollback**: Must roll forward or back
- **Capacity reduction**: During deployment
- **Complex for stateful services**

**Best Practices**:
- Maintain N+1 capacity during deployment
- Implement connection draining
- Use health checks before rejoining
- Version compatibility for at least N-1

**Interview Example Answer**:
"We used rolling deployments with ECS, updating 25% of tasks at a time. Connection draining ensured no dropped requests. We maintained backward compatibility for APIs and database schemas across versions. This balanced deployment speed with safety."

### üî¥ Red-Black Deployment
**What**: Similar to blue-green but with immediate cutover and no rollback environment.
**Difference from Blue-Green**: Previous version is terminated after successful deployment.
**Use Case**: When rollback strategy is roll-forward, saving infrastructure costs.

### üåü Feature Toggle Deployment
**What**: Deploy code with features disabled, enable via configuration without redeployment.

**Benefits**:
- **Decouple deployment from release**
- **Instant rollback**: Just toggle off
- **A/B testing**: Different features for different users
- **Gradual rollout**: Percentage-based activation

**Implementation**:
- **Simple**: Environment variables, config files
- **Advanced**: Feature flag services (LaunchDarkly, Split.io, AWS AppConfig)

**Interview Example Answer**:
"We separated deployment from release using feature flags. New features deployed dark, then gradually enabled via LaunchDarkly. This allowed us to deploy daily but release features when business was ready, and instantly disable problematic features without rollback."

### üèóÔ∏è Recreate Deployment
**What**: Shut down old version completely, then deploy new version.

**When to Use**:
- Development environments
- When downtime is acceptable
- Major incompatible changes
- Limited resources

**Process**:
1. Stop all old version instances
2. Deploy new version to all instances
3. Start all new instances

**Interview Note**: "We only used recreate strategy in dev environments where downtime was acceptable and we needed to ensure clean state."

### üéØ Shadow/Dark Deployment
**What**: Deploy new version alongside production, mirror traffic for testing without affecting users.

**How it works**:
- Production traffic duplicated to shadow version
- Shadow responses are discarded
- Compare metrics between versions
- No user impact from shadow errors

**Use Cases**:
- Performance testing with real traffic
- Validating major refactoring
- Testing new infrastructure
- Load testing without affecting users

**Implementation Tools**:
- Istio mirroring
- AWS ALB traffic mirroring
- Custom proxy solutions

### üöÅ A/B Testing Deployment
**What**: Different features/versions for different user segments simultaneously.

**Routing Strategies**:
- User ID hash
- Geographic location
- Device type
- Random assignment
- User preferences/profile

**Metrics to Track**:
- Conversion rates
- User engagement
- Performance metrics
- Error rates per variant

**Statistical Significance**:
- Define sample size needed
- Run for complete business cycles
- Account for seasonality
- Use proper statistical tests

### üìä Deployment Strategy Selection Matrix

| Strategy | Downtime | Rollback Speed | Cost | Risk | Complexity |
|----------|----------|----------------|------|------|------------|
| Recreate | Yes | Slow | Low | High | Low |
| Rolling | No | Slow | Low | Medium | Medium |
| Blue-Green | No | Instant | High | Low | Medium |
| Canary | No | Fast | Medium | Low | High |

## ‚úÖ DevOps Best Practices & Patterns

### üìú The Twelve-Factor App Methodology
**Purpose**: Guidelines for building scalable, maintainable applications.
**Key Factors**: 
1. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
3. **Config**: Store config in environment variables
4. **Backing services**: Treat backing services as attached resources
5. **Build, release, run**: Strictly separate build and run stages
6. **Processes**: Execute app as one or more stateless processes
7. **Port binding**: Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model
9. **Disposability**: Fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/prod parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
12. **Admin processes**: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

**Interview tip**: Mention specific examples like "We implemented factor 3 by using AWS Parameter Store for configuration management."
